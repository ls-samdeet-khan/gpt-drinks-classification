# gpt-drinks-classification

This is a project that utilizes the OpenAI GPT 3.5-turbo API for classifying drink types and subtypes based on existing item data (e.g. accounting group name, location, and item name). Due to limitations on the 3.5-turbo model, extensive prompt engineering has been required to achieve some functionality with auto-classification. However, access to the 4.0 enterprise model would significantly improve the performance of this current process, with the same prompt.
